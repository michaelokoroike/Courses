- Data is extremely important
- Text, number, or boolean is the general type of data...this is simple
- What about more complex things, like students (name, grades, etc)...this is where object-oriented programming (OOP) languages come in
- In OOP languauges, you create classes like Student, with attributes like name (string), gpa (number), year (String), etc
- Create functions off these classes, like one that would determine if a student has honors or whether to give the student a scholarship
- Objects are instances of classes...these are the things to work with in the project, and are implementations of the classes...you can create as many of these objects as possible
