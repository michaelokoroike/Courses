## Getting Started (section #1)

Video 1 - Overview
- Coding is a universal skill; it is the new world of properly expressing algorithms that can be run on computer
- This course introduces us to syntax and operator precedence, and then intro into more advanced programming
- Good for science, humanities, etc...good for everyone
- C is good
  - Invented in 1970; a systems implementation language
  - Learn low-level understanding that programs like Java, Python don't provide

Video 2 - History of C
- Invented by Dennis Ritchie in 1972...won Turing Award because of it
- Purpose was to write an operating system...that operating system is Unix
- Done at Bell Labs and was released as a free product
- Beginning of the minicomputer era
- Basis of Linux and under the hood mechanism behind MacOS

## First Program (section #2)

Video 3 - Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part 1
- In C, what is needed is a compiler and an editor
  - Editor = Plain text editor (text on my computer)
  - Compiler = GNU compiler and GNU command GCC (to compile C code)
- Write code on paper first
- Executable a.out is output if the output does not detect syntax errors

Video 4 - Compiling, debugging, and running a program, part 2
- "vi" in Unix means read a file
- "gcc" command in Unix is to compile a C file

Video 5 - First Program
- C facts
  - small...only 29 keywords
  - low-level
  - efficient
  - a systems implementation language; made to replace B and BCPL; reliant on "algol 60"
- Hello World program for C...
  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int main ()
  - {
  - printf(
    - "helloworld\n")
  - return 0;
  - }
