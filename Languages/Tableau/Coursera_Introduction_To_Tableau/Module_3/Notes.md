Video 1 - Welcome to Week 3
- Recap of what we've learned
  - Importance of data visualization
  - Accessing Tableau's data source page and connecting to/preprocessing data (hiding/renaming/pivoting/splitting fields, editing field data types)
- Only worked with one table within a data source, but what about analyzing more than one table within a data source? Or multiple tables from different data sources?
  - We'll learn first accessing multiple tables in a single data source, and then from multiple data sources
  - We'll learn about live connections and extracts
