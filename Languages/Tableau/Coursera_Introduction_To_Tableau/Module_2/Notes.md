## Preprocess the Data Source (section #1)

Video 1 - Welcome to Week 2
- Preprocessing, data types, and data splits will be gone over in this module
- 1st lesson: Before data can be analyzed, it should be wrangled (prepared for analysis)...preprocessing
- 2nd lesson: Learn about the data types and the importance of ensuring each field is appropriately categorized with the data type that makes the most sense for the analysis...data types
- 3rd lesson: May be times when it's helpful to split a field into multiple fields...splits

Reading - Data Preparation
- We will learn to rename fields, hide fields, pivot fields, change field data types, split fields

Reading - Rename Fields
- Essential for increased readability; unclear field names leave too much room for interpretation of what the field contains

Video 2 - Rename Fields
- Right-click or double click on the column header to rename the column

Reading - Hide Fields
- Workbook can become crowded with fields when we have large datasets in Tableau
- Tableau allows you to hide fields temporarily

Video 3 - Hide Fields
- Right-click and choose 'Hide'

Reading - Pivot Fields
- Example explains why a pivot field is appropriate:

- Create new file from Personal Tableau page by...1) Close from File menu; 2) Don't Publish; 3) "Create a Viz"

Video 4 - Pivot Fields
- Drag over fields you want to stack together and right-click...press pivot
- Two fields are returned...Pivot Field Names and Pivot Field Values; hide Pivot Field Names, rename Pivot Field Values
- Note: To pivot actually changes the data

Reading - Optional: Explore the Data Interpreter
- Mainly used for spreadsheets with titles, notes, footers, empty cells, etc can be ignored and removed using this tool
- If not the proper type of file, too big, or clean, Data Interpreter will not appear as an option (on the left pane)
