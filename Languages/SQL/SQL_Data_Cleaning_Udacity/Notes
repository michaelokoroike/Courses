Video 1: Introduction to Data Cleaning
- We will learn to clean and reorgainizing messy data
- We will learn how to change a column's data type
- We will learn some tricks on how to manipulate NULLs

Video 2: LEFT & RIGHT
- Example: SELECT first_name,
                  last_name,
                  phone_number,
                  LEFT(phone_number, 3) AS area_code              #LEFT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the beginning (or from the left)
                  RIGHT(phone_number, 8) AS phone_number_only     #RIGHT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the end (or from the right)
                  RIGHT(phone_number, LENGTH(phone_number) - 4) AS phone_number_alt #LENGTH provides the number of characters for each row of a specified column
           FROM customer_data

Video 3: POSITION, STRPOS, & SUBSTR
- Example: SELECT first_name,
                  last_name,
                  city_state,
                  POSITION(',' IN city_state) AS comma_position               #POSITION takes a character and a column, and provides the index where that character is for each row
                  STRPOS(city_state, ',') AS substr_comma_position            #STRPOS provides the same result as POSITION, but the syntax for achieving those results is a bit different as shown here: STRPOS(city_state, ',')
                  LOWER(city_state)                                           #LOWER makes every string in a character to become lowercase 
                  UPPER(city_state)                                           #UPPER makes every string in a character to become uppercase 
                  LEFT(city_state, POSITION(',' IN city_state) - 1)  AS city  #Everything in the city_state value up to and including a character before the comma (which is the city)
           FROM customer_data
- Note: POSITION and STRPOS are case-sensitive

Video 4: CONCAT
- Example: SELECT first_name,
                  last_name,
                  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
                  first_name || ' ' || last_name, AS full_name_alt
