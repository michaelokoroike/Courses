Video 1 - Introduction to Window Functions
- Window function allows you to compare one row to another without doing any JOINs 
- Create running totals, determine if one row was greater than the previous row, and classify based on finding
- Most people don't get this far as beginners

Video 2 - Window Functions 1
- Example of creating a running total (below):
- SELECT standard_qty,  
         SUM(standard_qty) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total #will create an aggregation/running total with out needing GROUP BY...reads as "take the sum of standard_qty, across all rows up to a given row, in order by occurred_at 
    FROM accounts
-  Note: Use PARTITION BY to narrow the window from entire dataset to individual groups within a data set. Example below builds on above:
- SELECT standard_qty, 
         DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month #find the month
         SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total #goes over month
    FROM accounts
