Video 1: Introduction
- We will learn in this lesson to query the results of another query
- This will allow us to build out more transformations, organize work better, and make queries run faster

Video 2: Introduction to Subqueries
- Also known as inner queries or nested queries
- Allow you to answer more complex questions than you could with a single table
- 1) Start with querying the entire table to see if it can do what we need it for; 2) next we'll count all of the events in each channel by day; 3) then we'll want to average across events column we've created. This
  creates a subquery, which are required to have aliases
- Example: SELECT channel,
                  AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
           FROM
           (SELECT DATE('TRUNC', occurred_at) AS day,
                  channel,
                  COUNT(*) AS event_count
           FROM web_events
           GROUP BY 1,2)
           GROUP BY 1
           ORDER BY 2 DESC
