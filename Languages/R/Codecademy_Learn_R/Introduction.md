## Introduction (section #1)

**Why R?**
- Intro by course creators: "Ahoy! We R excited for you to start your learning adventure with a language built for data enthusiasts! The R community is made up of people passionate about the intersection of numbers,
  data, analysis, and code. In this lesson, we will introduce you to some basic R syntax and discuss how R classifies data types so that it can mathematically process them in analysis. But before you go any further,
  letâ€™s talk about how R is different from most programming languages. Unlike with other languages, most beginners who want to learn R do so because they want to analyze data. In this way, R is more of a tool to
  understand data than a programming language used to build software applications. Our approach to teaching you R will be similar to teaching you how to use a new tool. What is the tool for? R is powerful for
  conducting statistics and other specialized data analysis. It was invented by scientists for statistical computing and a community of specialized packages has been built around the language."
