## Development Environment Setup (section #2)

Reading: Welcome to Introduction to HTML5
- Instructor introduction
- Learning about HTML5 basics in this course

Video 1 - Development Environment Setup, Part 1
- Need Github, Google Chrome browser (Chrome Developer Tools comes with it), sublime text 3 (code editor...visual studio code, brackets other options), Git, Browser Sync (need NodeJS)

Video 2 - Development Environment Setup, Part 2 (MacOS)
- Don't need this
- sublime text installed (the code of a webpage is done in here)
  - html + ctrl/space + enter gives an html template
  - in terminal, going to directory of your html files, then running (browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*") starts a tab in your browser that will update as you change things in sublime text...have to save to see the updates
- Git version = 2.39.2 (do things in terminall related to Github)
- NodeJS version = v20.15.1
- npm version = 10.7.0 (user local bin in our path (echo $PATH))
- browser-sync version = 3.0.2 (use this to run html files and as we change them with sublime text, the html files change automatically)

Video 3 - Development Environment Setup, Part 2 (Windows)
- did it all when watching video 2

Optional Practice Quiz - Browser Sync install

Video 4 - Development Environment Setup, Part 3: Github and Browser Sync
- To learn Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 (first 2 or 3 pages)
- got it figured out how to change the layout of my webpage from Githubâ€¦create a _config.yml page at your main folder in your repository, then https://pages.github.com/themes/, then click one of them, then click the _config.yml of that repository, then copy what  is in that file and paste it in your file and go from there
- You would need to merge if you did old school launch automatic page generator and it made another branch where the html info was...merge onto the html info branch
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/4T1t0/development-environment-setup-part-3-github-and-browser-sync is the site for all the knowledge
