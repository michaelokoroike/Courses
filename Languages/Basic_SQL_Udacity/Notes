Video 3 (& Text): The Parch & Posey Database
- One way to store data is on spreadsheets
- When we need lots of spreadsheets to store data from different sources, we can visualize these using an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)...each spreadsheet is represented by a table; at the top is the title of
  the spreadsheet and below (in the diagram in the video) the column names are listed. SQL CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO QUERY ACROSS ONE OR MULTIPLE TABLES.
