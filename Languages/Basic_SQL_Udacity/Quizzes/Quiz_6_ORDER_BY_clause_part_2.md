## Practice Question 3
- The results differ from PQ1 to PQ2 because the order in which the table is sorted is decided by which clause is denoted first in the ORDER BY clause
- When ordering by total_amt_usd first, we are essentially sorted by largest order values in the dataset down...when ordering by account_id first, we get largest order to smallest order historically, for each account from the smallest account number to the largest
