Reading - Using Javascript to Build Web Locations
- From course creator: "Welcome to the last module of this course and the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers Specialization! Now that above learned JavaScript language fundamentals, we will dive into using JavaScript and manipulate elements within our webpage as well as use AJAX to pull real data from a server, without the need for the user to reload the entire page. We'll finish off the module by using our newly acquired JavaScript and AJAX skills to complete the restaurant website, so it pulls its content and menu data from the server and dynamically generates HTML for the view. See you in the module."
