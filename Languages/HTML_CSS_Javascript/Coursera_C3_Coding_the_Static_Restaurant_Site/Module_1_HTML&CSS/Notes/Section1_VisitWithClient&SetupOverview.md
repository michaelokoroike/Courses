Reading - Welcome to Course 3: Coding the Static Restaurant Site
- From author: "Hello, and welcome to Course 3 of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers Specialization! I'm very happy you decided to enroll, and most importantly, start the course work. To introduce myself, my name is Yakov Heiken, and I will be your instructor for this course. I've been teaching part-time at graduate computer science program of Johns Hopkins University for over ten years. My full time job is developing small and large scale web applications, working with both front end and server side technologies. This course is a real journey where we will code a real web site for a real client from scratch. And you will get to sit right next to me as I go through this process. We'll start with going over some tips on how to work with your client and how to extract requirements for you projects. Then we will dive into our main topic, coding the website. In the previous module, we only briefly introduced Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework. In this module, we will be learning the Bootstrap framework as we code this real website and we'll finish off the module with testing our completed website on a mobile phone. Pretty exciting stuff. See you in the module."
