## Cascading Style Sheets Basics (section #1)

Reading: Welcome to Course 2: Introduction to CSS3
- Instructor note: "This course is all about foundations of cascading style sheets. We will start with the basics, move on to rule conflict resolution, the box model, and CSS layout techniques. Then, we'll be learning how to use media queries and code responsive websites without any frameworks. It would be a mistake to jump straight to a responsive frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap without first understanding the foundation topics. We will finish up the module with an introduction to the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework, which is one of the most popular CSS frameworks today. Keep going and you will finish the course in no time. See you in the module."

- Basically a new course is coming on CSS

Video 1: Lecture 11: Power of CSS
- If all you wanted was raw content you could take HTML files upload them to a server and there they'd be...but we need style and creative presentation (don't want a house without drywall covering the actual bricks and stuff); this is the point of CSS

  - selector tag; basically says, in this example, what's in the curly brackets should apply to every p tag in the entire html page
  - declaration: what's inside the curly brackets
    - property: color in this example (predefined by CSS specification...also for every property there are predefined values)
    - value: blue in the example
- CSS rules can consist of several declarations (maybe color, font-size, width, etc)
- Stylesheet: collection of CSS rules (see below):

  - styling (see style tag) can be placed in the head section of an html page, even though not best practice
