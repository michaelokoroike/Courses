  - It is intended to be scalable; for small script writing to large
  - Used at companies like the above
- Analogy of cathedral vs bazaar...cathedral takes a while to build and is fairly unchangeable, while a bazaar is interchangeable (Scala is the bazaar)

Video 2 - Scala code and the Scala interpreter

  - Scala is object oriented because every value is an object and every operation is a method call
  - If we add 2 + 4 in an interpreter, Scala rewrites it, and the plus is a method being called on the object 2
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1bf5e6b-afc0-4d45-9aab-85b0d7e0e3d3)
  - Functions are (add above this) first class values like integers/strings...pass as args to other functions, return them from functions, store them in variables etc
  - Functions should only map inputs to outputs and not change data in place
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40ac8f7-1838-4717-84e2-5f1455101503)
  - Scala is concise compared to Java; high-level language; advanced static type system; compatible to build off of Java code

  - res0 being reusable is cool...doesn't happen on a println (see below)

  - Functions and methods are not the same
 
Video 3 - Immutable variables (val) and value types
- Two types of variables in Scala = val (immutable...cannot be reassigned (give another value)) and var (mutable)
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c602bcca-791f-47e7-a0be-c2adbcdecb92)
- All variables have types...most common are Double, Int, Boolean, and String
  - Double = A more precise float
  - Int = integer...negative 2 billion to positive 2 billion
    - Scala.int
  - Boolean = True or False
  - String = A sequence of Char
