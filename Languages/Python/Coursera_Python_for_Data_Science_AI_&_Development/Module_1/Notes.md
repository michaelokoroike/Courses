## Getting Started with Python and Jupyter (section #2)

Video 1 - Introduction to Python
- Python is for those who already know how to program, people who want to learn to program, data professionals, areas like data science/AI and machine learning/web development/Internet of Things (IoT) with
  devices like Raspberry Pi, large organizations like Facebook/Amazon/etc
- It is a general-purpose language, has a large standard library
- For Data Science, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- For AI, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn
- For Natural Languauge Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Reading - Introduction to Jupyter
- **Jupyter** = is a freely available web application that enables creation and sharing of documents containing equations, live coding, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter provides an interactive
  computing environment that supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and more, but it shines brightest when used with Python.  Jupyter revolves around notebooks, documents containing a
  mix of code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and multimedia content. These notebooks allow users to create, share, and collaborate on computational projects seamlessly.
- Popularity is from ease of use
- Key features/advantages of Jupyter
  -  Interactive computing
  -  Support for multiple languages
  -  Rich output
  -  Integration with data science libraries
  -  Collaboration and sharing
- Indispensable in data science due to seamless integration with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and sci-kit-learn, making it the go-to choice for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
