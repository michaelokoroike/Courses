# Courses Taken

**Machine Learning**
- *Machine Learning - Coursera Specialization (Audit with Notes)* = This course specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, Geoff Ladwig, Aarti Bagul, and Eddy Shyu. Here we learned to build machine learning models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression). We learned to build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods. We learned to apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection. And finally, we learned building recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & building a deep reinforcement learning model.
- *Mathematics for Machine Learning & Data Science - Coursera Specialization (Audit with Notes)* = This course specialization is taught by [Luis Serrano](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/luis-serrano). Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science is a 
beginner-friendly Specialization where we learned the fundamental mathematics toolkit of machine learning: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability.

**Languages**
 - Python
 - *SQL for Data Analysis - Udacity Specialization* = This course specialization is taught by [Derek Steer](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud198). In it, we Learn how to execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access, aggregate, and join data and data tables. We also learn to understand when and how to use subqueries, several window functions, and partitions to complete complex tasks. Finally, we learn to clean data, optimize SQL queries and write select advanced JOINs to enhance analysis performance.
